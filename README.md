# topchef
This is a project using a MongoDB database with Spring backend along with Angular on the client.

The application is a single-page CRUD app for Recipe management and also supports administrative roles 
for users.  There is a mock-data endpoint that allows you to quickly create a test-database for developmental
or experimental purposes.  The mock endpoints are topchef/mock/create/units and topchef/mock/create/users.  These
endpoints do not require authentication and should be disabled if you are using this codebase in a
production environment.
